    "album_description": "Proteus is the Second oldest Parade at New Orleans Mardi Gras. Founded in 1882, Proteus (&quot;PROH tee us&quot;) The shepherd of the Oceans, is an early sea-god, one of several deities whom Homer the Old Man of the Sea has always held elaborate masked Tableau Balls and the most beautiful Street Parade to date.\n\nin 1893 the Krewe first introduced the tradition of call outs, Where masked costumed Krewe members invited ladies in attendance to step out on the dance floor with them. This custom was then adopted by many other Krewes including Rex.\n\nThe Identity of the King of Proteus is never revealed to the public. His Parade float is a giant Seashell and very march part of the New Orleans Carnival scene for generations.\n\nProteus did not parade from 1993 - 1999 but returned to parading on Lundi Gras (The Monday before Mardi Gras Day, Shrove Tuesday, or Fat Tuesday) in 2000. The Parade of The Krewe of Proteus Follows the Traditional Uptown or St. Charles Route ending on Canal Street. The actual Krewe of Proteus parade floats are still using the original chassis from the early 1880's.\n\nThe Mythical Proteus\nThe son of Poseidon in the Olympian theology ( Homer,Odyssey iv. 432), or of Nereus and Doris, or of Oceanus and a Naiad, and was made the herdsman of Poseidon's seals, the great bull seal at the center of the harem. He can foretell the future, but, in a mytheme familiar from several cultures, will change his shape to avoid having to; he will answer only to someone who is capable of capturing him. From this feature of Proteus comes the adjective protean, with the general meaning of &quot;versatile&quot;, &quot;mutable&quot;, &quot;capable of assuming many forms&quot;: &quot;Protean&quot; has positive connotations of flexibility, versatility and adaptability.\n\nProteus is also known as a shape shifter and can assume the guise of anyone or anything he so chooses. When held fast despite his struggles, he will assume his usual form of an old man and tell the future.\nThe so-called Old Man of the Sea, is a prophetic sea divinity, son of either Poseidon or Oceanus. He usually stays on the Island of Pharos, near Egypt, where he herds the seals of Poseidon. He will foretell the future to those who can seize him, but when caught he rapidly assumes all possible varying forms to avoid prophesying.\n\nProteus [PROH-tee-us], like all six of Neptune's newly discovered small satellites, is one of the darkest objects in the solar system -- &quot;as dark as soot&quot; is not too strong of a description. Discovered by Stephen Synnott, Like Saturn's satellite, Phoebe, it reflects only 6 percent of the sunlight that strikes it. Proteus is about 400 kilometers (250 miles) in diameter, larger than Nereid. It wasn't discovered from Earth because it is so close to Neptune that it is lost in the glare of reflected sunlight. Proteus circles Neptune at a distance of about 92,800 kilometers (57,700 miles) above the cloud tops, and completes one orbit in 26 hours, 54 minutes. Scientists say it is about as large as a satellite can be without being pulled into a spherical shape by its own gravity. Proteus is irregularly shaped and shows no sign of any geological modification. It circles the planet in the same direction as Neptune rotates, and remains close to Neptune's equatorial plane.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.kreweofproteus.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.kreweofproteus.com/</a>",

Class of 2011 Cadet Blake Fitzgerald, the cadet-in-charge, has been involved in the Special Olympics event here since his plebe year first as a\nsponsor for two years than as the assistant CIC.\n\n\u201cThis is a great leadership opportunity to serve the\ncommunity and continue the tradition of selfless service,\u201d Fitzgerald said. \u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed being involved in extracurricular activities, and this has been a privilige leading cadets in this amazing community service.\u201d\n\nAlong with the 25 members of Omicron\nDelta Kappa, more than 700 cadets volunteered\nto sponsor athletes and work in various support\nteams to record track times and particpate in\naward ceremonies. Many cadet-athletes from\nArmy rugby, sprint football, hockey and the Rabble Rousers provided support throughout the day at Shea Stadium.\n\nIn addition, more than 150 community volunteers also participated.\n\nFitzgerald said the day was not about the cadets\nthough; deserving the attention were the hundreds of athletes throughout the Hudson Valley region who came to demonstrate their skills.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that after today, you will have\nsuccessfully proven your courage and your physical fitness and experience joy in these friendly competitions,\u201d Fitzgerald told the athletes during the opening ceremonies. \u201cToday is not about winning, but rather an exeprience that will teach you life lessons.\u201d\n\nLt. Gen. David Huntoon Jr., West Point superintendent, was the grand marshal and expressed pride in the athletes and their families for attending the 37th annual regional games.\n\n\u201cYour presence today and your participation in these games is all about teamwork and discipline, selfless service, honor and courage,\u201d Huntoon said. \u201cThose are some of the principle values of the U.S. Army and West Point. In your\neyes, we can see the determination to win the race, the passion to succeed and to overcome any obstacle in order to accomplish the mission. And today\u2019s mission is about achievement and about doing your very best here on the playing fields and in your life.\u201d\n\nAthletes earning gold medals in their events will be able to advance to the state competition in Ithaca next month where more than 1,500 athletes and coaches from across the state will participate in the 2011 State Summer Games.",

    "album_description": "Following the Class of 2011 Graduation Parade on May 20, each regiment in the Corps of Cadets marched to their formation areas for I Company activation ceremonies. \n\nThis would not be the first activation of an I Company; historically, when the size of Corps requires it, regiments will absorb additional companies. The National Defense Authorization Act of 1965 increased the Corps Authorized Strength from 2,505 cadets to 4,417 cadets. By 1967 the Corps grew to 3,370 cadets and expanded from 24 to 32 companies \u2013 the very same organization USCC has in place today with an authorized strength of 4,400. In 1969, the Corps numbered at 3,785 and added four more cadet companies for a total of 36 companies \u2013the desired organizational design for today\u2019s 4,400 cadets. The NDAA of 2009 directed the Corps strength back to 4,400.\n\nThe expansion to 36 companies increases cadet to TAC Team interaction given a 10% decrease of cadets in each company. This increased interaction is vital to the support and assessment functions which are the cornerstone of our Cadet Leader Development System. ",

    "album_description": "<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/usaghumphreys\" rel=\"nofollow\">Learn More</a>\nBy Steven Hoover\nSteve.hoover@us.army.mil\n \nCAMP HUMPHREYS \u2013 A children\u2019s play area, which has been dubbed \u201cSuper Park,\u201d and features equipment that allows children of all abilities to use the play place, was officially opened here Nov. 30.\n \nDue to inclement weather, the ceremony was moved into the Super Gym, where about 40 children from the Child Development Center\u2019s Strong Beginnings classes recited the Pledge of Allegiance and then sang \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d before participating in the ribbon cutting.\n \nThe \u201cinclusive design\u201d of the equipment makes it easier for all children to use the equipment and, according to officials, was the primary reason the contract was awarded to Playworld Systems. This company has built similar playgrounds at Fort Gordon, Ga., Fort Sill, Okla., Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, and Yokota Air Base, Japan.\n \nThe park, which was built here, essentially, with money the garrison was awarded during the 2009 Army Communities of Excellence program, is located adjacent to the Super Gym parking garage and cost roughly $493,000. ACOE is a program for the total Army which focuses on improvements in the environment, in services and facilities, improving working and living conditions, renewing pride and developing a sense of accomplishment in every member of the community.\n \nThe U.S. Army Garrison Humphreys Directorate of Public Works\u2019 Master Planning Division created the Super Park concept in conjunction with the Directorate of Family, Morale, and Welfare.\n \n\u201cIt was extremely challenging to find a location not affected by the ongoing transformation,\u201d said Dennis Polaski, director of DPW. \u201cThis opportunity became available when it was determined that a future satellite post office, originally sited in the location, would not fit and had to be relocated. With more than 85 percent of the garrison families residing off-post, this new park is a significant quality of life improvement at Camp Humphreys.\u201d\n \nPolaski credits Suzanne James, director of the Camp Humphrey Army Community Services, with \u201cbeing responsible for bringing this vision and concept to reality.\u201d\n \nJayme Stelker, a Camp Humphreys Family member and the mother of three, said \u201cThe new park is awesome. Thanks.\u201d\n \nThe playground equipment is divided into play areas for ages 2-5 and then ages 5-12. Among other things, it provides accessible routes into, around and within the play space, makes all ground-level activities accessible and is intended to create an identical or equivalent play experience for every child.\n \nAlso included are two pavilions, playground equipment, picnic tables and benches. In the spring, grills will be added. The pavilions can be reserved and rented through FMWR\u2019s Outdoor Recreation, located in Bldg. S-1044, which is behind the Super Gym parking garage. The number to call is 753-3013.\n\nU.S. Army photos by Steven Hoover",

Many of the songs they sang are really, really good.&rdquo;\n\nAuto Reverse was the band and they sung some favorite MJ songs, including &ldquo;Thriller&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black and White.&rdquo;  \n\n&ldquo;I like the Michael Jackson Thriller theme, because I love Michael Jackson,&rdquo; said Pfc.

I participated in the Save the Light Half-Marathon, running 13.1 miles back and forth through the neighborhood around Folly Beach, South Carolina. The goal of the event is to raise money for the local lighthouse.\n\nIt was a big deal for me, since I had never run more than 12 miles in my entire life. Even worse, working two jobs and moving into a new apartment kept me from training very much in the weeks before the race. (As excuses go, those are pretty good.) I knew I was in for an exhausting event, so I made some time and ran 8 miles about a week prior to the event. I felt just fine, so I gambled that 13.1 miles wouldn\u2019t be too much harder than 12.",

Instead of making allowances for people who want to bring their dogs, this event encouraged it. In fact, it was the standard. There were dogs everywhere.",

This race was really close to the JFK/UMASS stop on Boston\u2019s Red Line, and I live really close to the Quincy Center stop on the same line. This meant that getting to the site would be really, really convenient. Unlike other races, I was able to take my time with coffee and breakfast before heading out. I was even able to dawdle a bit and post a quick morning video.",

At Relay, teams of people camp out at a local high school, park, or fairground and take turns walking or running around a track or path. Each team is asked to have a representative on the track at all times during the event. Because cancer never sleeps, Relays are overnight events up to 24 hours in length.",

It will coincide with the annual Combined Associations Conference, which brings together members of the Officers and Enlisted Associations \u2014 professional organizations National Guard members may choose to join.\n\nThe theme for this year\u2019s conference is \u201cAdding Value to Our Communities, State and Nation.\u201d Senior military leaders and deployed North Dakota National Guard commanders will offer insights reflective on that theme to the nearly 500 registrants. \n\nThree top military leaders will kick off the main portion of the conference Friday morning; they include Lt. Gen. Harry M. Wyatt III, director of the Air National Guard; Lt. Gen. Robert R. Allardice, 18th Air Force commander at Scott Air Force Base, Ill.; and Maj. Gen. Raymond W.

Maj. Gen. David Sprynczynatyk, North Dakota National Guard adjutant general, will give his State of the North Dakota National Guard address, as well. \n\nThe conference\u2019s keynote speaker, Retired Sgt. 1st Class Dana Bowman will speak on \u201cManaging Change: The Only Constant\u201d and, as the closing address, on \u201cConquering Adversity.\u201d Bowman served in the Army as a Special Forces Soldier and member of the Army\u2019s elite Golden Knights parachute team. Bowman lost his legs during a 1994 training accident with the Knights, and nine months later became the first double amputee to re-enlist in the Army. \n\nPortions of the conference will be targeted toward military families, including a direct address from Sprynczynatyk and sessions titled, \u201cVolunteers: Where the Rubber Meets the Road,\u201d \u201cPreparing for Disasters, Deployments and Difficulties\u201d and \u201cKids Serve, Too.\u201d A working lunch on Saturday will address \u201cSoldiers and Airmen: Caring for our Own.\u201d \n\nDuring a banquet Saturday evening, the North Dakota Army National Guard will name the Enlisted Soldier of the Year and Noncommissioned Officer of the Year out of a group of finalists who have been preparing and testing for the past year. Additionally, North Dakota\u2019s National Guard Association will name the Company-Grade Officer of the Year and Field-Grade Officer of the Year for the Army and Air Guard. Airmen of the Year, who were named during a March 6 ceremony, will be recognized, as well. \n\nAn additional award, the National Guard Association of the United States\u2019 Charles Dick Medal of Merit, will be presented to Congressman Earl Pomeroy on Sunday. The award recognizes contributions to the National Guard by elected officials. \n",

    "album_description": "Guard Aviation Soldiers Return to N.D. after Serving in Iraq\n\nBISMARCK, N.D. \u2014 After a year of serving in Iraq and completing thousands of flight hours, forty-five Soldiers of the North Dakota National Guard\u2019s Bismarck based Company C, 2nd Battalion, 285th Aviation Regiment (C/2-285th AVN) are back in North Dakota. Over 200 Family members and friends welcomed them home shortly after 2 p.m., when their charter flight arrived at the Bismarck Airport\u2019s main terminal. Two of the Soldiers live out of state and traveled separately to Minnesota. The 47 Soldiers have been on active duty since last October and served in Iraq since December.\n\n\u201cThese aviation Soldiers have done an outstanding job serving in Iraq and have proudly represented our state and nation,\u201d said Gov. John Hoeven who was on hand to greet the Soldiers. \u201cToday, we welcome them home with our heartfelt gratitude for their service and sacrifice, and we thank their families who also served their country throughout this deployment.\u201d\n\nBefore returning home, the Soldiers arrived at HUFort SillU, Okla. last Wednesday to complete their demobilization process. HUMaj. Gen. David SprynczynatykUH, North Dakota adjutant general, and other senior leaders traveled to Oklahoma to welcome the Soldiers home, and they also greeted the Soldiers upon their arrival in Bismarck.\n\n\u201cThese Soldiers have been away from their Families, friends and communities, performing outstanding aviation tasks throughout Iraq for a year,\u201d Sprynczynatyk said. \u201cThey highly commended for their professionalism by their command. I am proud of all they have accomplished during this deployment and happy to be among the family and friends welcoming them home.\u201d\n\nThe unit flew more than 750 combat missions totaling more than 6,200 flight hours. Assigned to the 1st Infantry Division, they were responsible for transporting senior officials, Soldiers, medical supplies and other cargo in Iraq. The unit is commanded by Capt. Douglas Larsen, of Granville, N.D. The senior enlisted Soldier is 1st Sgt. Daniel Marquart, of Bismarck.\n\nThe typical aviator averages 100-125 flight hours and the typical crew chief averages 75-100 flight hours per year in North Dakota. On the average, the flight crews are getting 350-500 flight hours on this deployment. That equals roughly four years worth of experience for a typical pilot and roughly five years worth of experience for a crew chief as compared to typical home station flight time. The enlisted members have also gained many years worth of valuable maintenance experience.\n\n\u201cThe experience gained in Iraq will definitely improve the North Dakota Army National Guard aviation program. Put it all together and we will have strong, knowledgeable, and experienced crews available for any future homeland defense or state emergency missions,\u201d Larsen said.\n\nCompany C is comprised of 10 Blackhawk helicopters and assigned crews of which North Dakota has five, with the other half comprised of Soldiers from the Utah Army National Guard. The unit consists of pilots, crew chiefs, door gunners, mechanics, fuelers and flight operations personnel.\n\n\u2014\u2014\nSince the 2001 terrorist attacks on America, the North Dakota National Guard has mobilized more than 3,500 Soldiers and more than 1,800 Airmen in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Currently, about 75 North Dakota Guardsmen are serving overseas while more than 4,000 remain in the state for emergency response and national defense.  For every 10,000 citizens in North Dakota, 65 serve in the North Dakota National Guard, a rate that\u2019s more than four times the national average.\n###\n",

    "album_description": "BISMARCK, N.D. -- The 14th annual Red Ribbon Carnival was held Oct. 27 at the Raymond J. Bohn Armory in Bismarck. \nThe North Dakota National Guard Counterdrug Program along with committee members from NDSU Extension, Police Youth Bureau, and the Mandan Police Department hosted the event for area students of all ages and their parents.\n \u201cThe purpose of the Red Ribbon Carnival is to bring awareness of drug prevention to the community,\u201d said Maj. Jocelyn Gallagher, a committee member from the North Dakota National Guard Counterdrug Drug Demand Reduction Program.\nLetters are sent out to surrounding schools from the committee inviting them to participate in the carnival. If a school decides to participate, they reply to the committee with an idea for a booth or fundraiser they would like to have at the carnival. The committee monitors the various types of booths and fundraisers to ensure a diverse educational and fun experience is provided.\nThe carnival is not just a good resource for the children, though. Parents are given a chance to discuss topics that would normally be harder to talk about.\n\u201cInformation presented at the carnival can spark conversations between parents and their children that might not otherwise come up,\u201d said Staff Sgt. Melanie Vincent, another committee member from the North Dakota National Guard Counterdrug Drug Demand Reduction Program. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a parent lecturing their child, but the whole community helping the children to make good choices.\u201d \n\u201cAdults get useful education too, such as knowledge about different resources that are available if they need help with a child who is abusing substances,\u201d added Vincent.\nBy creating an environment where being drug free is discussed in a fun, relaxed manner, the Red Ribbon Carnival allows parents and children to discuss openly without the normal stresses associated with such conversations.\n\u201cRed Ribbon Carnivals help keep the information about prevention out there while providing positive role models. It allows children to have fun with the whole family while becoming educated about the dangers of drugs,\u201d said Gallagher.\n\u201cThe community is very involved with the event through donations and the schools provide a lot of support. Without the community and Bismarck/Mandan schools, the carnival wouldn\u2019t be possible,\u201d said Vincent. \n",

    "album_description": "Nine teams competed in the Western Regional Medical Command Top Medic Team Competition held at Fort Wainwright from Sept. 13 through 16 at Fort Wainwright. \nCompetitors arrived on Monday and took a written test on medical knowledge. \nTuesday was a long day that started with a 4 a.m. PT assessment, and included an obstacle course, the firing of an M-9 and M-16 and ended with a night land-navigation course. On Wednesday the Soldiers took on the challenge of the trauma lane where they treated casualties with severe bleeding, and head, leg, eye and chest injuries. Soldiers then carried their patients to safety through smoke and various hazards while explosions rocked the course. \nFinally, in the early morning hours of Thursday, the contest ended with a 12-mile ruck march. \nThe team from Weed Army Community Hospital from Fort Irwin, Ca. took 1st place in the competition. Team members were Sgt. Clodomiro Espinoza, Staff Sgt. Adam Sahlberg, Spc. Jason Silva and Sgt. Victor Torres.\nThe team from Bassett Army Community Hospital at Fort Wainwright Alaska came in 2nd place.  Capt. Joshua Walters, Spc. Kayla McCarthy, Pfc. Delroy Walker, and Pfc. Joseph Escueta, represented BACH.\nSoldiers from General Leonard Wood Army Community Hospital finished 3rd in the competition. Team members were Sgt Alexander Folsom, Staff Sgt. Matthew Hamilton, Staff Sgt Scott Herrington, and Spc. Michael Shea.\nDespite the long hours, sore muscles, blisters and other complaints, teams were already talking about competing next year at the awards ceremony.",

    ],
    "album_description": "One of the Fort Wainwright garrison commander\u2019s responsibilities is government-to- government relations with the federally-recognized tribes of the Upper Tanana River, including consulting with all the local tribes in the Interior.\nWhen World War II veteran Paul Kirsteatter died, said Col. Ron Johnson, Fort Wainwright garrison commander, \u201cI wanted to do something to recognize his service. So I talked to the family and told them since he was a veteran he was entitled to some benefits for his funeral and that sort of thing and asked if they would be interested.\u201d\nThe family accepted and planning  began immediately. However, arranging this sort of tribute for a man who resided at Healy Lake, with a year-round population of less than 20 which is generally only accessible by boat, helicopter or float plane had to be planned like a military operation Johnson said. \n \u201cIt took some coordination with (U.S. Army Alaska); developed a primary course of action, a contingency course of action and an emergency course of action.\u201d\n\u201cThe original plan was to take a couple of riverboats from Family and Morale Welfare and Recreation and local community guys to ferry them to Healy Lake. It\u2019s challenging and a little risky,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we saw teams were too big for boats, we got support from USARAK, from aviation, allowing us to fly everyone in.\u201d\nInstead of turning this over to the casualty assistance office, as is usually done, Johnson contacted Col. Brian Reed, commander of the 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, known as the \u201cArctic Wolves.\u201d \nJohnson told Reed that he had a great chance for some Soldiers to experience a part of Alaska that few ever get a chance to see and asked if he had some Soldiers who might appreciate the opportunity. Reed decided to award it to the Soldiers of the Brigade Troops Battalion, and Lt. Col.  Michael Braun, commander of the BTB, selected 12 Arctic Wolves he considered worthy. They were accompanied by a musician from the 9th Army Band and flown to the remote village by four members of B Company, 1st Battalion, 52nd Aviation Regiment in a Chinook helicopter.\nThe celebration of life was beside the lake, near Kirsteatter\u2019s cabin. As part of the ceremony,  the band\u2019s bugler played \u201cTaps\u201d and the Soldiers fired a 21-gun salute. A Soldier then presented an American flag to Kirsteatter\u2019s daughter Dorothy.\nFollowing the ceremony, the villagers held potluck dinner in the community hall, where the Soldiers had a chance to interact with Kirsteatter\u2019s family and friends. \n\u201cIt was really amazing,\u201d said Spc. John Keeling, 73rd Engineer Company, Brigade Troops Battalion, 1-25th SBCT. \u201cI had never done anything like this before; it was my first time and it was special doing this for a veteran - not just for a veteran, but a World War II veteran. It is a pretty big deal to us. \n\u201cThe community reception has been amazing\u201d he said. \u201cThey opened up and it was just nice to hear everybody\u2019s comments and then they made food for everybody. We felt welcome.\u201d\n",

At this point we chose the top path instead of the one leading down to Oude Schip point, which forks at a point past <a href=\"http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=ebb362d2-de6e-4cfd-bd05-7f7d6a23394a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rocket House</a> - one path continues down to the point, while the other follows the coastline around the bay to the BOS 400 wreck (and continues on to Hout Bay).\n\nUnfortunately the upper very narrow and badly-eroded &quot;trail&quot; leads to much bundu-bashing and rock scrambling, and eventually a dead end.\n\n<a href=\"http://runkeeper.com/user/coda/activity/64374678\" rel=\"nofollow\">Map on RunKeeper</a>",

    "album_description": "Playboy Business: Kendra Wilkinson Reality In Sydney at Ivy\n\nShe's known for a few things, mainly Playboy, The Playboy Mansion, and all that, but now she's got a Reality TV show, and us Australians are going to find out all about it.\n\nThe 26-year-old model - actor - entrepreneur has been spotted sight seeing in Sydney, while getting ready to promote her self titled reality TV show, Kendra.\n\nThe blonde media heat seeker, always very well-known for being one of Hugh Hefner's lucky three girlfriends had a whale of a time enjoying a boat cruise around Sydney Harbour with her mum, while taking photos. Yes, her photo was also taken.\n\nKendra arrived in Down Under on 13th October and snatched quite a few cheers and wolf whistle's from the Sydney Airport staff. The walk past is understood to have lifted the striking workers spirits. Naughty, naughty.\n\nThe glamour model did tonight (or at least the first part of it) at the exclusive Sydney night spot, The Ivy.\n\nLike many a celeb, she's quite the fan of Twitter, yesterday tweeting: 'Wow I'm having the best time in Sydney!! Australia is amazing! Can't wait to show you guys my pics from my trip!'\n\nKendra's reality TV show focuses mainly on her life after leaving the famous Playboy Mansion and getting engaged to then Philadelphia Eagles receiver, Hank Baskett. Kendra is understood to enjoy ball sports.\n\nThe star's virgin appearance on TV was via the TV series 'The Girls Next Door', which followed the lives of Playboy Hefner's, then-girlfriends: Kendra, Holly Madison, and Bridget Marquardt.\n\nBefore you could say Playboy Bunny, Kendra moved out of the Playboy Mansion in 2009 after meeting future husband Hank, and began filming her Kendra.\n\nAmerican audiences were into the show and Kendra is praying that Australian audiences will feel the same way too. Well, they are bound to feel something, so hopefully its good.\n\nThe former Dancing With The Stars contestant married Hank in June 2009, and their boy Hank IV was born in December of that year. In case you were wondering, the star's family have not joined her on her latest press trip.\n\nKendra looked to be enjoying herself at The Ivy tonight, and it sure looks like she's into the Australian mantra of &quot;Work hard, play harder.&quot;\n\nThe looker has told Australian press: &quot;The mansion will always be a part of my life and I'm very appreciative of that. Especially Hef. He is like family. So when the time comes I will open up to my son about my days there and the stuff I went through,&quot; she said.\n\n&quot;I knew what I wanted. It was always to have a family&quot;.\n\n&quot;No one really expected that of me. I went away that no one thought I would go. Everyone thought I was the crazy party girl but I did what everyone thought I wouldn't do and made a huge turn-around in my life. I always wanted to be a mother and a wife.\n\n&quot;I lived at the mansion from the age of 18 to 21 and once I had that experience and that whole party thing out of my system I was really ready to settle down.&quot;\n\nAustralian news hounds are expected to continue to track her every movement, and Kendra plays along in the game, making sure everyone knows about her new upcoming Reality TV show.\n\nKendra: 9.30pm from October 18, only on E!\n\nWebsites\n\nThe Ivy\n<a href=\"http://www.merivale.com/#/ivy/ivyroom\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.merivale.com/#/ivy/ivyroom</a>\n\nFoxtel: E!\n<a href=\"http://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/channels/e!/default.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/channels/e!/default.htm</a>\n\nSplash News\n<a href=\"http://www.splashnews.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.splashnews.com</a>\n\nEva Rinaldi Photography\n<a href=\"http://www.evarinaldi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.evarinaldi.com</a>\n\nEva Rinaldi Photography Flickr\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography\">www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography</a>\n",

A marathon of multi-instrumentalism.\n\nTwo ambitious musicians take up more than 20 instruments to present Mike Oldfield's classic hitTubular Bells in a unique musical - and acrobatic - performance. Oldfield's beautiful and sprawling progressive Celtic-folk-rock opus shot to number one in charts around the world in 1973-4.\n\nNow Sydney multi-instrumentalists Daniel Holdsworth and Aidan Roberts have arranged the entire score of Tubular Bells to be played live by just two blokes, bringing the influential masterpiece to life in all its multi-layered madness and subtle beauty.\n\nWebsite\n\nSydney Festival \n<a href=\"http://www.sydneyfestival.org.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sydneyfestival.org.au</a>\n\nSplash News\n<a href=\"http://www.splashnews.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.splashnews.com</a>\n\nMusic News Australia\n<a href=\"http://www.musicnewsaustralia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.musicnewsaustralia.com</a>\n",

His parents and four siblings were all of normal size, but Andr\u00e9 suffered from acromegaly, a hormonal disorder that results when the pituitary gland produces excess growth hormone. As the Giant grew up (very quickly, as he reached the height of 6' 3&quot; by the age of 12) he began to often disagree with his parents. He left home at 14 and obtained a job with a furniture-moving firm and began to play rugby. At 17 he was seen training at a gym by several professional wrestlers. Impressed by his size, they taught him some basic wrestling skills and built a friendship with him. Later, when one of the wrestlers was injured, Andr\u00e9 stepped in for him. He would wrestle for nearly thirty more years. By his early 20s Andr\u00e9 had wrestled in Algeria, South Africa, Morocco, Tunisia, England, Scotland, and most of non-Communist Europe but had not found fame. In 1971 he came to North America under the name Jean Ferre and was mildly popular in Canada. Then he met a New York based booker by the name of Vincent J. McMahon (often incorrectly referred to as &quot;Vince McMahon Sr&quot;) who renamed him &quot;Andre the Giant,&quot; and billed him as 7' 4&quot; (Andre was really closer to 7'). Soon Andre the Giant became a national sensation and was a much sought after wrestler. In addition he participated in television, movies, and commercials. With his wealth the Giant bought a ranch in Ellerbe, North Carolina where he would live during his rare time off and after he retired from wrestling in 1990. He died while in France after attending his father's funeral. Andr\u00e9 was cremated and his ashes were spread across his ranch. He is survived by his one daughter.\n\nIMDb Mini Biography By: J.W. Braun  \n\n\nMini Biography\nWhen Andre The Giant challenged Hulk Hogan for the WWF World's Heavyweight Wrestling Championship of The World at WrestleMania III in 1987, he hadn't lost a single's match since 1971. His 3,000 plus winning streak was ended when Hogan picked up the 7 foot tall and 500 pound Giant and body slammed him for the pin. Over 94,000 fans viewed this history making match-up, setting an indoor record which still stands today. Andre also defeated Heavyweight Boxing contender Chuck Wepner in a wrestler vs. boxer match on the under-card of the Muhammad Ali/Antonio Inoki challenge match in Japan. The 6 feet 6 inch. Wepner was thrown completely out of the ring.\n\nIMDb Mini Biography By: angelsunchained \n\nTrade Mark\nTrademark move: Bearhug\n\nTrademark move: Headbutt\n\nTrademark move: Choke\n\nTrademark move: Big Splash\n\nTrademark move: Elbow Drop\n\nTrademark move: Double Underhook Suplex\n\nTrademark move: Tombstone Piledriver\n\nTrademark move: Big Boot\n\nTrademark move: Knife-Edged Chops\n\nEnormous stature and frame\n\nTowering height\n\n\nTrivia\nFormer WWF tag team champion w/ Haku.\n\nAppeared at the first 6 WrestleManias.\n\nWrestleMania (1985) (V) Beat Big John Studd in a bodyslam match.\n\nWrestleMania 2 (1986) (V): Won a WWF/NFL Battle Royal.\n\nWrestleMania III (1987) (V): Lost to Hulk Hogan (event set an indoor attendance record that still stands).\n\nWrestleMania IV (1988) (V): Received bye in Round 1 of tournament, fought to a double DQ with Hulk Hogan in Round 2.\n\nWrestleMania VI (1990) (V): Lost tag team titles with Tonga Fifita (a.k.a.

He turned good again after WrestleMania VI (1990) (V), after Bobby Heenan blamed the Giant for losing the WWF Tag Team belts he and Tonga Fifita (a.k.a. Haku) held to Bill Eadie and Barry Darsow (a.k.a. Demolition).\n\nAfter pinning Hulk Hogan (even though &quot;the Hulkster&quot; clearly had his left shoulder raised) and being awarded the WWF World Championship belt, Andre &quot;surrendered&quot; it immediately to Ted DiBiase (who, in a storyline, was said to have paid Andre to give him the belt, should he win it); DiBiase previously had tried, without success, to either win or purchase Hogan's title.\n\nAndre's 1988 match vs. Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Championship, which he won in controversial fashion, was the 1988 Pro Wrestling Illustrated &quot;Match of the Year.&quot; The match, which took place in Indianapolis, was part of the first professional wrestling program to air in prime-time since the mid-'50s.\n\nAndre's most bitter feud began in 1983, against Big John Studd (who claimed he, not Andre, was the true &quot;giant&quot; of wrestling). The feud included a series of bodyslam matches (including one at WrestleMania (1985) (V), where Studd had to pay $10,000 (later, $15,000) to anyone who could bodyslam him.\n\nMade his last WWF appearance in 1991 at Summerslam (1991) (V), as a second to The Bushwhackers in their match against the 'Natural Disasters'.\n\nOne of Andre's most memorable feuds was in 1981 vs. Killer Khan. The feud exploded after a May 2 match, wherein Khan (who had cheated throughout the match) broke Andre's knee by leaping on it. Nearly four months later, Andre returned and demanded a rematch vs. Khan ... and got it. He beat Khan so badly the Mongolian superstar had to be carried from the ring on a stretcher. Andre also won a series of &quot;stretcher&quot; matches against Khan in the fall of 1981.\n\nAppeared in WrestleMania VII (1991) (V) in the corner of The Big Bossman when he took on Curt Hennig (aka Mr. Perfect) for the Intercontinental championship.\n\nContrary to popular belief, Killer Khan didn't break Andre's leg. Andre actually got out of bed one day, and his leg snapped due to his life-threatening illness. He was out for weeks, and the story was that Killer Khan did it, to hype up their feud.\n\nHad a very close friendship with WWE referee Tim White.\n\nSole survivor of the 1987 WWF Survivor Series main event, which pitted himself, King Kong Bundy, &quot;Ravishing&quot; Rick Rude, George Gray (aka One Man Gang) and &quot;The Natural&quot; Butch Reed against the team of Hulk Hogan, Ken Patera, &quot;Mr. Wonderful&quot; Paul Orndorff, &quot;The Rock&quot; Don Muraco and 'Scott 'Bam Bam' Bigelow' in an elimination match. He pinned Bigelow to win the match.\n\nWas an expert card player and collector of fine wines.\n\nWas a close friend of Bobby Heenan (aka &quot;The Brain&quot;).\n\nNotable title wins include: IWA Tag Titles with Michael Nader; Austral-Asian Tag Titles with Ron Miller; NWA U.S. (Tri-State) Tag Titles with Dusty Rhodes; Florida Tag Titles with Rhodes; WWF Heavyweight Title; WWF Tag Team Titles (with Tonga Fifita, aka Haku).\n\nWashington Redskins head coach George Allen once offered Andre a contract to play professional football.\n\nHe would not commonly address people by their names, instead, if he liked someone he would call them &quot;Boss&quot;.\n\nIt wasn't until he was an adult, on a wrestling tour of Japan, that he went to see doctors to determine the cause of his condition. The Japanese doctors diagnosed the cause as acromegaly, a rare condition in which victims are not expected to live beyond the age of 40. Andre lived to be 46.\n\nGodfather of Bill Eadie's daughter.\n\nAndre was defeated by Jerry Lawler (aka &quot;The King&quot;) in a match circa 1975. Lawler had caused Andre to be knocked from the ring, and Andre was unable to answer the ten-count, thus giving rise to the infamous story &quot;The Night Andre the Giant lost to a midget!&quot;.\n\nHe weighed 530 pounds at the time of his death.\n\nBecause of his size, he had a custom built recliner in his home that he always sat in when he was not on the road.\n\nAs a child, his next-door neighbor was Samuel Beckett.\n\nInducted into the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2002 (charter class).\n\nPrevious Managers: Bobby Heenan, Ted DiBiase, Frank Valois, Lou Albano, KY Wakamatsu, Tim White.\n\nFormer World Tag Team champion.\n\nActually signed all his personal checks, &quot;Andre the Giant&quot;.\n\nAndre continued to compete in tag team matches, primarily in Japan and Mexico, until the end of 1992.\n\nWrestleMania V (1989) (TV): Lost by DQ to Jake Roberts (aka Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts).\n\nBilly Crystal was inspired to write the script to the movie My Giant (1998) from having worked with 'Andre The Giant' in the The Princess Bride (1987).\n\nFormer NWA Tri-State Tag Team Champion.\n\nWas considered for the role of Jaws in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977).\n\nMentioned in the 1974 Guinness Book of World Records as the highest paid wrestler in history, up to that time. He earned $400,000 in one year alone during the early 1970s.\n\nDaughter is Robin Christiansen who was born in 1979. Her mother is Jean Christiansen of the Seattle, Washington area.\n\nSamuel Beckett, his neighbor, used to drive him to school.\n\nIn 1965, Andre the Giant received a draft notice for French's peace time army, but was unable to join as there were no shoes big enough, bunks long enough, or trenches deep enough to accommodate him.\n\nNFL legend Ernie Holmes got hot-headed backstage at a WWE taping in 1986. Andre the Giant muttered to him, &quot;You know, you talk too much,&quot; and Holmes never said a peep after that. According to two people in the van when it happened (it was a rehearsal for the Battle Royal at Wrestlemania II), Holmes was talking about how tough he was, and Andre got tired of hearing about it.\n\nOne time in the early 1980s during an early stint Bad News Brown had with WWE, the wrestlers were all on a bus traveling between shows. A very drunk Andre the Giant was in the back of the bus with Hulk Hogan and company telling racist jokes that Bad News Brown took offense to. Bad News Brown stood up, and yelled for him to shut up, then when he turned around, Andre cursed at him. Bad News Brown had the driver stop the bus, and told Andre to meet him outside. Andre refused, and Hogan, and others tried to soothe the situation. The next day Andre apologized to Bad News Brown. Bad News Brown later admitted he was glad nothing ever happened because he believed Andre could have really hurt him.\n\nIn the mid 1970s, four men were hassling Andre at a bar and he got angry and decided to so something about so he chased the guys out of the bar. They got in their car and thought they were safe. They were wrong. Andre proceeded to roll the car on to its roof and then left.\n\nFrom Bobby Heenan's book: Andre had a bad habit of never buttoning his shirt in public places. One day, Andre and the Brain were in a small country and western bar, when Andre had refused to button his shirt. A bouncer demanded that Andre button his shirt. Andre remained silent and continued to drink. The manager called the police. The officer that arrived reminded Heenan of Barney Fife from The Andy Griffith Show. &quot;Barney&quot; told Andre to button his shirt. Andre still drank quietly. &quot;Barney&quot; called for backup. &quot;Barney&quot; asked that Andre button his shirt again when several officers came in to backup &quot;Barney.&quot; Andre stood up, and &quot;Barney&quot; realized that it was just too hot to be indoors.\n\nDespite his character Fezzik's almost-superhuman strength in The Princess Bride, Andre the Giant's back problems at the time prevented him from actually lifting anything heavy. Robin Wright Penn had to be attached to wires in the scene where Buttercup jumps from the castle window into Fezzik's arms because he couldn't support her himself.\n\nAccording to author William Goldman, when he was first trying to get The Princess Bride made in the 1970s, a then-unknown Arnold Schwarzenegger wanted to play Fezzik, and he was strongly being considered because Goldman could never get his first choice, Andre the Giant to read for the role. By the time the movie was made about twelve years later, Arnold was such a big star they could not afford him, and Andre was cast after all, and the two big men had gone on to become friends.\n\nDuring the filming of some scenes for The Princess Bride, the weather became markedly cold for Robin Wright Penn. Andre the Giant helped her by placing one of his hands over her head; his hands were so large that one would entirely cover the top of her head, keeping her warm.\n\nEnjoyed playing card games such as Cribbage and Gin Rummy.\n\nWas a fan of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (1983).\n\nIs referenced in the Eminem song 'Crack a Bottle'\n",

She has appeared on Australian Story and been awarded an Order of Australia and QLD Senior Australian of the Year for her work.\n\nThe appointment has been graciously accepted by Mrs Argent who is said to be honoured.\n\n&quot;This is an acknowledgement of all those parents and families who are supportive of their gay and lesbian loved ones, Argent said. &quot;It also shows me that the community supports and appreciates the work I do.&quot;\n\nKylie Minogue news...\n\nYes, Kylie is returning to Mardi Gras Sydney tonight.\n\n&quot;Please dear, dear Sydney, just keep the rain away while we party, Kylie told Fairfax Media &quot;A lot of effort is still going into the performance on Saturday night and, personally, I'm excited to see the parade and feel the spirit of the city, the spirit of the people and to be part of that is a beautiful thing.&quot; Her upcoming appearance at the Mardigrasland Party in the Entertainment Quarter is sold out. Its been 14 years since she graced Mardi Gras and said her 2012 return &quot;just felt right&quot;. &quot;It's hard to believe I've been in music for 25 years, and in showbiz even longer,&quot; she said. After Mardi Gras, she will present her music in a more stripped-back setting as part of the ongoing K25 celebrations. On Thursday night, she attended the Sydney Mardi Gras VIP party at Sheraton on the Park, but no Kylie at today's media call, but lots of discussion about her of course, with police sniffer dogs, Dykes On Bikes and the Love Muscle float all enjoying healthy discussion.\n\nKylie! Australia's pop queen will not only perform at the Mardi Gras party, but it will be a 20-minute medley of songs stretching from her first album to her most recent, Aphrodite.\n\nMinogue's song arrangements are completely tailor-made for the show, to be held in the Royal Hall of Industries at an unspecified time during the night, backed by 16 dancers, all Aussies. The songs are a surprise. RuPaul is confirmed.\n\nWell done to everyone involved in the preparation of Sydney Mardi Gras.\n\nPress Release...\n\nSydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (SGLMG) are proud to announce today, Optus as the Official Digital Rights Partner for the 2012 Sydney Mardi Gras Season.\n\nThe Sydney Mardi Gras Parade will be shown online, in high definition on, SGLMGs new dedicated website mardigrastv.org.au , powered by Optus, making the world- famous Parade accessible to a global audience for the first time ever.\n\nThis is a game changing opportunity for SGLMG and Optus to transform Sydney Mardi Gras 2012, and deliver a digital experience to the world.\n\nThe Sydney Mardi Gras festival will be showcased to a world-wide audience, for the first time at mardigrastv.org.au.

    "album_description": "Country music legend Kenny Rogers performs State Theatre, Sydney; Australian music legend John Williamson supports...\n\nKenny Rogers is an American singer-songwriter, record producer, actor, photographer and entrepreneur. \n\nHe has been most successful with country audiences and has charted more than 120 hit singles across various music genres and topping the country and pop album charts for more than 200 individual weeks in the United States alone.\n\nTonight Rogers performed to an appreciative Australian audience at the famous State Theatre in Sydney.\n\nHe was supported by Australian country legend John Williamson and I couldn't think of a better support in the world, but there can be little doubt that the majority of people were there to see Rogers.\n\nBoth artists engaged with the audience, as only season veterans could do.  Rogers even got into a money throwing act with a fan. \n\nRogers is one of very few artists who have enjoyed successful careers in such a variety of genres - jazz, folk, rock, country and pop. Houston-born Rogers formed his first band while in high school in 1956 - a rockabilly group called The Scholars (they performed on American Bandstand) - and has never quit making music. He played stand-up bass in the jazz group the Bobby Doyle Trio, and later became a member of the popular folk group, The New Christy Minstrels. The spotlight started focusing on Rogers when his group, The First Edition, scored their first hit, &quot;I Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In), which was followed by the pop and country chart success of &quot;Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town.&quot;\n\nRogers' solo career shot into the stratosphere with the #1 hit, &quot;Lucille,&quot; which was named the CMA's Single of the Year and was certified Gold.  &quot;Daytime Friends,&quot; &quot;Sweet Music Man,&quot; and &quot;Love Or Something Like It&quot; continued his run of success. Then came &quot;The Gambler,&quot; a story song so vivid it not only delighted country and pop fans, it also became a TV movie, starring Rogers himself in the title role. The movie spawned four follow-ups, making it the longest running miniseries franchise on television. The five Gambler mini-series have attracted over 100 million viewers nationwide and launched a second career for Rogers as an actor on television and movies.\n\nNews...\n\nKenny Rogers autobiography out in October...\n\nWith Rogers 50 years of performing and 120 million album sales, there's a lot to write about.\n\nHe says &quot;It stirs up certain emotions that you'd forgotten about. Particularly when your life has been as busy as mine - it's kind of hard to keep up with things&quot;\n\n&quot;I must admit I enjoyed writing it. I enjoyed that process. I don't know that I'd want to do it again.&quot;\n\nMore News...\n\nThe pinnacle of his career is in the late 1970s to '80s and includes hits such as The Gambler, Lucille, Coward of the County and, with Dolly Parton, Islands In the Stream. He has had 24 No.1 hits.\n\n&quot;Once I started with Lucille [in 1977], it was like an indescribable career for anybody, so you have a look at that and say: how can you not have enjoyed that?&quot; Rogers says. &quot;But I have to tell ya: too much success is not good either. I'm at a great place right now where I sign enough autographs to satisfy my ego, but not so many that it invades my privacy.&quot;\n\nIn 2009 Rogers did widespread touring under the anniversary banner The First Fifty Years. He still performs or records about 100 days annually. But turning 74 next week, with a much younger wife and twin eight-year-old boys at his home in Atlanta, he expects his Australian concerts will be his last here.\n\n&quot;This is probably gonna be my last international tour,&quot; he says. It's because his family can't be with him. &quot;So I think when I come back \u2026 that's gonna be it. I'm gonna stay home then.\n\n&quot;I'll continue to tour the States. I'd just like to be able to get home [more] so I can spend what I think is quality time with the boys \u2026 I really wanna be there for 'em instead of being gone all the time.&quot;\n\nRogers has said his one regret is the toll his pursuit of success had on his relationships. But &quot;I don't want to go back and rehash things that I was honest about and paid the price for. I don't want to pay it again.&quot;\n\nKenny Rogers will also play at the State Theatre tomorrow night, again supported by John Williamson.\n\nIf Rogers other performances down under in Australia are anything like tonight's, fans are in for a massive treat from this true music legend, and his new Aussie legend mate.\n\nAustralian Tour Dates...\n\nSYDNEY, NSW AUSTRALIA\nAugust 16, 2012 9:00 p.m.\nState Theatre\nWith Special Guest John Williamson \n\nDARWIN, NORTHERN TERRITORY AUSTRALIA\nAugust 18, 2012 9:45 p.m.\nDarwin Festival\nGeorge Brown Botanic Gardens\nWith Special Guest Sara Storer \n\nPERTH, AUSTRALIA\nAugust 21, 2012 9:00 p.m.\nRiverside Theatre \nPerth Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre\nWith Special Guest Troy Cassar Daley \n\nMELBOURNE, VIC AUSTRALIA\nAugust 23, 2012 9:00 p.m.\nPalais Theatre\nWith Special Guest Troy Cassar Daley \n\nNEWCASTLE, NSW AUSTRALIA\nAugust 24, 2012 8:00 p.m.\nNewcastle Entertainment Centre\nWith Special Guest Lee Kernaghan\n\nGYMPIE, QUEENSLAND AUSTRALIA\nAugust 26, 2012 8:00 p.m.\nGympie Music Muster\n\nADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA\nAugust 29, 2012 9:00 p.m.\nAdelaide Entertainment Centre \nWith Special Guest Beccy Cole\n\nWebsites\n\nKenny Rogers official website\n<a href=\"http://www.kennyrogers.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.kennyrogers.com</a> \n\nJohn Williamson official website\n<a href=\"http://www.johnwilliamson.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.johnwilliamson.com.au</a> \n\nState Theatre\n<a href=\"http://www.statetheatre.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.statetheatre.com.au</a> \n\nEva Rinaldi Photography Flickr\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography\">www.flickr.com/evarinaldiphotography</a> \n\nEva Rinaldi Photography\n<a href=\"http://www.evarinaldi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.evarinaldi.com</a> \n\nMusic News Australia\n<a href=\"http://www.musicnewsaustralia.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.musicnewsaustralia.com</a>\n",

    "album_description": "Georgia May Jagger in Sydney, Australia; Sunglass Hut floats on Sydney Harbour with celebrities and product pitch...\n\nSunglass hut... the sunglasses retail company is back to publicity tricks using the good old fashioned celebrity sells... in this case with Mick Jagger's daughter, Georgia May Jagger, and friends, aboard a floating product promotional boat on Sydney Harbour. Not a bad combo and it achieved the goal - free headlines.\n\nLooking at Georgia May Jagger, it\u2019s impossible to miss the shades on her famous parents. Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall. Some press is saying she\u2019s the very best blend of her parents\u2019 charisma and good looks. Ah, the benefits of being a famous offspring... and good work opportunities often come your way including product promotions.\n\nIn Australia on a promotional tour with Sunglass Hut, she stars in their current advertising campaign with boyfriend musician and model, Josh McClennan. She told Fairfax Media &quot;We\u2019d never worked together before \u2013 so it was an interesting experience. Kind of a laugh seeing your boyfriend posing \u2013 we had a lot of fun&quot;, she said. Guest stars at tonight\u2019s A-list party aboard the Sunglass Hut floating store, they are checking out the sights of Sydney &quot;We\u2019re climbing the Harbour Bridge today, we\u2019ve seen sharks at the aquarium and we\u2019re in love with Bondi Beach&quot;.\n\nGeorgia is a hot, smart and music appreciating Brit. &quot;There was always music in the house growing up \u2013 I love all kinds from blues through to rock 'n' roll. I tried the violin and guitar when I was young, but never really learned to play\u2026and my Mum doesn\u2019t play anything either.&quot;\n\nGeorgia May is familiar with the modeling and advertising world with cosmetic contracts, major advertising campaigns and her fair share of magazine covers including UK Vogue, UK Elle and this month\u2019s Australian Harper's Bazaar. Yes, we know its got something to do with her famous parents, but good luck to her. That's the world and that's the business. &quot;I\u2019m really trying to have fun with it [modeling]. Obviously, I enjoy the travelling and getting to meet people from all over the world. It\u2019s wild to be working in London one day and then in Australia the next \u2013 I just want to keep doing it for as long as I can&quot;.\n\nAfter modeling, she hopes to move into a career in photography. She mentions her mum's Helmut Newtown pictures as inspiration. &quot;I was at university before my career took off and my plan is to be a photographer \u2013 my dream would be to travel and take pictures&quot; she said.\n\nMoving like Jagger in the Sunglass Hut campaign.\n\nWhen it comes to style, the model is a fan of Vivienne Westwood \u2013 she\u2019s the face of the new Westwood jewellery line \u2013 and has a try-anything-once approach to fashion. &quot;I pick up style from everywhere I go, I like to mix it up. I\u2018ve got some incredible vintage pieces from my mother\u2019s wardrobe - amazing dresses from her Studio 54 days\u201d.\n\nAnd what about her father\u2019s closet \u2013 has she managed to get her hands on any of Dad\u2019s iconic threads? \u201cMy sister [Lizzie] has a lot because she\u2019s got the tall skinny figure. I do have one thing of my Dad\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve got it and if he did he\u2019d want it back immediately\u2026for a museum&quot;.\n\nSunglass Hut floating store is moored in Darling Harbour, Sydney from November 15 - 18. 10 per cent of all profits from the Floating Store will be donated to OneSight, a leading global vision care charity.\n\n\nAbout Sunglass Hut...\n\nSunglass Hut is an international retailer of sunglasses and sunglass accessories founded in Miami, Florida in 1971.

    "album_description": "War Horse play enjoys Sydney, Australia media call at Lyric Theatre, The Star \n\nThis morning War Horse (the play - not the movie), enjoyed its Sydney media / production call.\n\nIt might have been a touch low on media attendance, but was high on talent, passion, and quality all around.\n\nThis Thursday War Horse will enjoy much more media attention with its Sydney red carpet premiere, however the Music News Australia and Media Man team were happy to get a leg up on the competition by getting an early look in at this world class production.\n\nThe acting, production, props and every other element certainly had a 5 star look and feel to it.\n\nIt's little wonder media and audiences have been raving about the production the world over.\n\nMedia quotes...\n\n\u201cWar Horse is extraordinary theatre. Brilliant, bold, moving, it is a world-class fusion of performance, design and specially puppetry.\u201d The Age \n\n\u201cEpic\u2026 Magnificent\u2026 Impressive.  You can almost smell the sweat and leather and hear the galloping hooves of their magnificent \u201canimals\u201d manipulated by master puppeteers.\u201d  - Herald Sun\n\n\u201cOutstanding. The production confidently says: Come along for the ride.\u201d  - The Australian\n \n\u201cUnique and breathtaking theatre.\u201d - Radio National\n \n\u201cTruly a spectacle that you have to experience.\u201d - 3AW\n\n&quot;Everything about War Horse looks to be 5 stars. The overall production, acting, consuming, the animal robotics. The interaction between the actors, the horses and the audience is amazing and has to be experienced to be believed. This version of War Horse is just as satisfying as the movie - maybe more so in some regards.  This may just be the best play to hit Australia this year. Highly recommended - Greg Tingle, Media Director - Media Man.\n\nThe Guardian's Michael Billington wrote in his review:\n\nElliott and Morris recreate the kaleidoscopic horror of war through bold imagery, including the remorseless advance of a manually operated tank, and through the line-drawings of Rae Smith projected on to a suspended screen. Admittedly the performers are somewhat eclipsed by the action ... The joy of the evening, however, lies in the skilled recreation of equine life and in its unshaken belief that mankind is ennobled by its love of the horse.\n\nCharles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph had written that, generally, &quot;puppets are often an embarrassment, involving a lot of effort and fuss for negligible returns&quot;; in this case, he praised the puppetry as &quot;truly magnificent creations by the Handspring Puppet Company.&quot; The Times' 10-year-old guest reviewer called the show &quot;movingly and realistically brought to life&quot; and &quot;an emotional and compelling adaptation of the book.&quot;\n\nIn reviewing the Broadway production, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, &quot;...it is how Joey is summoned into being, along with an assortment of other animals, that gives this production its ineffably theatrical magic...Beautifully designed by Rae Smith ... and Paule Constable, this production is also steeped in boilerplate sentimentality. Beneath its exquisite visual surface, it keeps pushing buttons like a sales clerk in a notions shop.&quot; Brantley suggests, &quot;The implicit plea not to be forgotten applies not just to the villagers, soldiers and horses portrayed here, but also to theater, as an evanescent art that lives on only in audiences\u2019 memories. Judged by that standard, much of War Horse evaporates not long after it ends. But I would wager that for a good while, you\u2019ll continue to see Joey in your dreams.&quot;\n\nEntertainment Weekly gave a positive review, calling the show an &quot;imaginative, moving new Broadway drama ... The play's equine stars are the remarkable creation of Adrian Kohler and Basil Jones' Handspring Puppet Company. As manipulated by three handlers dressed in period costumes, the life-size creatures seem to breathe, snort, feed, walk, gallop, and rear up just as naturally as the genuine articles. In no time at all, they become characters as rounded and complex as any of the humans on stage.&quot; Time magazine ranked the play as its top choice among all theatre productions in 2011.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Terry Teachout praised the puppetry, but gave mixed reactions to the play: &quot;The fundamental flaw of 'War Horse' is that Nick Stafford, who wrote the script 'in association' (that's how the credit reads) with South Africa's Handspring Puppet Company, has taken a book that was written for children and tried to give it the expressive weight of a play for adults. Not surprisingly, Mr. Morpurgo's plot can't stand the strain. Dramatic situations that work perfectly well in the context of the book play like Hollywood clich\u00e9s onstage. In the first act, the craftsmanship is so exquisite that this doesn't matter\u2014much\u2014but things go downhill fast after intermission. The really big problem is the last scene, about which, once again, the drama critics' code commands silence. This much must be said, though: A play that is so forthright about the horrors of war owes its audience a more honest ending.&quot;\n\nTheatre review aggregator Curtain Critic gave the production a score of 88 out of 100 based on the opinions of 21 critics.\n\n\nWAR HORSE MEDIA RELEASE:\n \nInternationally acclaimed critical and box office hit\n\nWar Horse... \n\nThe National Theatre of Great Britain and Global Creatures are proud to bring the multiple Tony and Olivier Award-winning War Horse, to Australia. \n\nApplauded by critics and audiences alike, War Horse held its Australian premiere in Melbourne on New Year\u2019s Eve at Arts Centre Melbourne\u2019s State Theatre.  After the Melbourne season War Horse will travel to Sydney for a season at the Sydney Lyric from Saturday 16 March, 2013 and to Brisbane for a season at Lyric Theatre from Saturday 6 July, 2013.\n \nSince its world premiere in London in 2007, War Horse has won numerous prestigious awards including two Laurence Olivier Awards, five Tony Awards and four Outer Critics\u2019 Circle Awards amongst a host of others. The Handspring Puppet Company has also won many accolades including a 2011 Special Tony Award.\n \n\u201cThe ANZAC spirit is deeply entrenched in the Australian ethos. We expect War Horse to have a great resonance in this country not only because of our connection to World War I but because themes of the land, loss and the ultimate triumph of friendship have a special place in the Australian psyche. We are proud to produce this highly acclaimed show with the National Theatre.\u201d says Carmen Pavlovic, CEO of Global Creatures.\n \nNick Stafford\u2019s stage adaptation of Michael Morpurgo\u2019s book, War Horse is a magnificent drama which tells the heart wrenching story of Joey, the beloved horse of a boy called Albert, who is sold to the cavalry at the outbreak of World War I and shipped to France.  He\u2019s soon caught up in enemy fire, and fate takes him on an extraordinary odyssey, serving on both sides before finding himself alone in no man\u2019s land.  But Albert cannot forget Joey and, still not old enough to enlist, he embarks on a treacherous mission to find him and bring him home.\n \nAt its heart are astonishing puppets strong enough for men to ride, created by South Africa\u2019s Handspring Puppet Company, who bring breathing, galloping, charging horses to life on the stage. Life size horses traverse the stage, their flanks, hides and sinews built of steel, leather and aircraft cables. Actors, working with these dynamic puppets, will lead Australian audiences on an emotionally-charged journey through history.\n \n&quot;War Horse is a life affirming story about friendship, courage and family, which appeals to all ages. This is a production that brings the family together, we get people coming back again and again, and they always have the same reaction. It awakens something in you,\u201d says Chris Harper, Producer, National Theatre of Great Britain.\n \nWar Horse has played to packed houses at London\u2019s National Theatre, the West End\u2019s New London Theatre and New York\u2019s Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. A further production opened in Toronto, Canada in February 2012 and a US tour commenced in June 2012. \n \nSteven Spielberg\u2019s movie adaptation of Michael Morpurgo\u2019s novel, released by DreamWorks Studios in late 2011, was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture.\n \nDirected by Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris, War Horse is designed by Rae Smith, with puppet design and fabrication by Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler for Handspring Puppet Company, lighting by Paule Constable, and movement and horse choreography by Toby Sedgwick; the puppetry directors are Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler, with video design by Leo Warner and Mark Grimmer, songmaker John Tams, music by Adrian Sutton and sound by Christopher Shutt.\n\nWebsites\n\nLyric Theatre, Sydney - War Horse\n<a href=\"http://www.sydneylyric.com.au/index.php/whats-on/current-show/War-Horse\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sydneylyric.com.au/index.php/whats-on/current-show/Wa...</a>\n\nLyric Theatre, Sydney\n<a href=\"http://www.sydneylyric.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.sydneylyric.com.au</a>\n\nWar Horse On Stage official website\n<a href=\"http://www.warhorseonstage.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.warhorseonstage.com</a>\n\nThe Star\n<a href=\"http://www.star.com.au\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.star.com.au</a>\n\nMedia Man Int\n<a href=\"http://www.mediamanint.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mediamanint.com</a>\n\nEva Rinaldi Photography\n<a href=\"http://www.evarinaldi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.evarinaldi.com</a>\n",

Many of the images are from the north and northeast of Phoenix.  5 of us went out to Cave Creek and then on to the Tonto National Forest in the hiking area around the Sears-Kay Ruin.  It's an ancient Hohokam ruin of a fortified village with remainsof 40 rooms.  The ruin itself is about a mile east of the desert images inclued in this set. Other images were taken at Desert Foothills Gardens in Cave Creek, and Black Canyon near the Rock Springs Cafe.",

Modern art museums always leave me wondering what I'm looking at - such as if something is an exhibit, unfinished construction, or the work of a six year old. What I really like is to walk by while people are discussing what the artist was trying to convey - my guess is the artist is sunning on some tropical island with all the cash he/she was paid for the painting. With that said, this is still a pretty interesting museum - especially on a rainy day!",

This is a great walking city and well worth visiting if you are in the area. This was my last full day in Germany and I wanted to see Dresden so I took the ICE from Frankfurt and it still took 5 hours each way - this made for a long day but it was definitely worth it. Next time I'll spend a day or two here - great city! ",

    "album_description": "Lower Antelope Canyon is one of the most famous slot canyons in the world. It is located a few miles from Page, Arizona; visiting it is an otherworldly experience. It is a photographers dream with great colors and natural formation.\n\nI arranged the photos in this set to go from entering the slot canyon to the turnaround point a few hundred yards away. I took most of the photos looking up at a sharp angle.\n\nIf you have a chance to visit either the Lower or Upper Antelope Canyon, do it - but it is getting expensive - in April 2010 it was a total of $26/person. You have to go in with a guided tour but If you ask, they will give you a Photo Pass that allows you to wander away from the group once inside.\n\nA tripod is a must inside the canyon, and watch out for fine dust blowing everywhere.  \n\nI took these photos in April 2010 as part of my Spring 2010 This Sure Beats Working Any Day tour.",

Still, its a nice collection of parts, at least as good as a Minicraft 1/144, and attractively priced.\n\nNote that there IS a MAD boom, which extends, and that the starboard horizontal stabilizer has been painted upside down - should be gray on top, white on bottom\n\nThis will be a fun build!",
